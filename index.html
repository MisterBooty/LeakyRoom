											</h1>
											<p>Introduction</p>
										</header>
										<p>I see the internet as a platform that anyone should be able to access safely. The internet today is unsecure for the general public and their private, sensitive digital information.
I believe that the public of New Zealand has little to no education about the type of their information that is being kept by the Government, Big Tech and underground organisations.
There is a massive unawareness of data privacy and freedom that everyone should be entitled to, regarding not only what we do online but also with our personal lives. As the internet grows and ages, it becomes more and more intertwined with basic living</p>

											<h3>Cameras</h3>
											<p>If you wander around wellington city and pay attention, you will discover that the CBD is absolutely filled with surveillance cameras. While this may seem concerning, our country uses CCTV only for security reasons unlike other nations. China and Europe have advanced their camera technology so that they identify individuals in crowds on the streets, through facial recognition. China itself uses the surveillance for a social credit system which limits and directs citizens on what they can and can’t do depending on their score. “China’s social-credit scoring is best understood not as a single system but as an overarching ideology: encompassing punishments and rewards, to improve governance and stamp out disorder and fraud.” (Campbell, 2019). This use of unnecessary surveillance by  government and big tech companies leaves many questions about data collection and privacy over innocent everyday civilians.</p>

											<h3>Data Centers</h3>
											<p> A data center is a building consisting of computing infrastructure and storage systems that governments and business use to contain large amounts of digital information. “Small businesses may operate successfully with several servers and storage arrays networked within a closet… while major computing organizations may fill an enormous warehouse space…” (Yasar, 2022). Data centers are typically relied on for its services such as processing, storing and disseminating big groups of data, as well as backup and recovery. This type of facility provides an important role in how data is stored in the “cloud”, and how it is kept safe and private. A data center usually includes systems for storing, sharing, accessing and processing. It features physical infrastructure for supporting data processing and communications, and utilities for cooling, electricity and uninterruptible power supply.</p>

											<h3>Smartphones, Tablets and Laptops</h3>
											<p>In this day and age, practically every adult owns a personal device, which shows how many of us rely on a connection to the internet for our everyday needs.  Now that anyone can have a tiny computer in their pocket means that these smart devices have become part of our society and us, physically, as human beings. While this ease of connectivity for society is a great tool for communication and information, social media platforms like “facebook, snapchat and Instagram leverage the very same neural circuitry used by slot machines and cocaine to keep us using their products as much as possible.” (Haynes, 2018). This constant dopamine high we get from clicking and tapping can distract many users from the importance of keep their data secure. Facebook alone has had many data leaks over the past years, with millions of users sensitive information such as passwords, messages etc leaked to unknown sources. Entering a simple password anyone could guess is an easy mistake, along clicking on random links sent by unknown users, or people posing as your friends. Small things that the average person perhaps might not consider dangerous can expose your sensitive data to the wrong people. </p>

											<h3>Flow of Information and Security</h3>
											<p>The flow of information when it comes to data and privacy is a lot like footprints. Wherever you happen to browse on the internet, a trail of data is left, just like walking on the beach. This is often referred to as a digital footprint or electronic shadow. It includes emails you sent, websites you visit and information you submit online. Digital footprints have the ability to be used to track someones digital online activities and different devices. Websites can track activity through the installation of cookies, and apps can collate your data from under your nose. If you allow a company access to your information, they are allowed to share or sell you data to third party accounts, which will most likely be used for personalised adverts. By giving an organization permission to your information, you risk your data becoming compromised as part of a data leak / breach.</p>

											<h3>Social and Cultural Impilcations</h3>
											<p>Society transforms into the digital era, and we leave the environment behind. Data centers have multiple negative effects on the environment, including “...nearly 1% of  global electricity demand, contributing to 0.3% of all global CO2 emissions.”(Ezra, 2021). Just like how our technology is advancing, these numbers will too.
Whilst the main point of security and surveillance is for the safety of public, there is a large grey area we can't ignore of when your privacy rights are breached. Once rights are infringed, the mistrust between government and people can escalate. Europe and China have already taken the first step and surveillance surrounds their nation. The collection of data, facial recognition and governments learning more and more about each individual is becoming increasingly like our new reality.
With the ease of access of technology, it is simple to forget that no matter the app you use, it tracks and keeps your data and uses it against you. Personlised advertisements are an example of just one of the ways companies keep track of your interests in order to keep your attention glued to the screen, and potentially take your money.</p>
